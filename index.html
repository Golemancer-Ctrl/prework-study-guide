        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here:</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>It is important to always remember to fill out the metadata in a page.</li>
          <li>A particularly important point of metadata is the viewport, which sizes the page to fit varied screens.</li>
          <li>There are many tags in HTML, but all of them use the angular bracket as demarkation.</li>
          <li>HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage's anatomy.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>
          <li>CSS is constructed differently from HTML, but useing some of the same tags.</li>
          <li>The HTML tags that appear in CSS are being defined or given style structure in the CSS.</li>
          <li>Once linked, external CSS sheets grant a developer the ability to totally transform the visual quality of their webpage.</li>
          <li>A tag like h1 would go without any prefix designation in the CSS.</li>
          <li>A class selector (i.e. '.card') is preceded with a period, which lets the CSS know it is a class.</li>
          <li>Color in CSS can be done many ways, from hexadecimals to words to hex #.</li>
          <li>CSS is like the skin, hair, eyes, and other aesthetic external bodyparts in a webpage's anatomy.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>Enter your Git notes here:</li>
           <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
           <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
           <li>Git status can be used to get an idea of what is being done and needs to be committed - use it OFTEN.</li>
           <li>Cd [path] can be used to navigate through folders in git, just using cd brings you back to the start.</li>
           <li>The 'touch file.type' allows us to directly create a file of any type through the console.</li>
           <li>Git is like the neural network of a webpage's anatomy, relaying information about the page between the branches and the main network.</li>
         </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here:</li>
          <li>Variables are your building blocks, serving to store data for easy access and to minimize repetition.</li>
          <li>Comments in JavaScript are the same as those in CSS - ex: /* your comment here */.</li>
          <li>One-line comments can be done simply as //comment.</li>
          <li>Operators allow you to do math with your JavaScript, from simple arithmetic to complex boolean comparisons.</li>
          <li>Conditionals like 'if... else...' allow you to test whether an expression is true or not.</li>
          <li>Functions, like variables, allow you to cut out tedious repetition and streamline your functional code into manageable building blocks.</li>
          <li>Events listen for an input and then output code in response - if you've ever clicked on a button in a webpage, you've used one!</li>
          <li>There are many key data types in JavaScript; Boolean, Undefined, Null, Numeric, Number, NaN, Strings, oh my!</li>
          <li>A BigInt is created by appending 'n' to the end of an integer or by calling the constructor.</li>
          <li>Beware of "stringly-typing" your code! Strings are tempting, but can be dangerous!  (Just ask the cat!)</li>
          <li>There is a built-in utility for representing dates, use it!</li>
          <li>JavaScript is like the muscles of our webpage's body, allowing it to interact more fluidly with the world.</li>
