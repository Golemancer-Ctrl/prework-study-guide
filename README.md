# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In the creation of my prework study guide, I sought to create a user-friendly, efficient webpage in which to store the notes I took while going through our introductory lessons.  I intend to continue to maintain and update it throughout the course and through my continued learning experience as a developer.  I hope to make it publicly available for use by other beginning developers through GitHub, in the hope it might ease their entry into the field.

I built this project to create a centralized location for all of the information I collected and will collect throughout my developer experience.  I also hope to use it as a method to hone my skills as a developer through real practice.  Through long-term application I hope that my updates and continued work will solidify my skills with HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

The storage of class notes has been a problem for students since the beginning of study.  My own college career was a toil of trying to centralize notes taken in multiple different mediums - Word documents, pen and paper, Google documents, PowerPoints, the list goes on.  Having a centralized hub for all my class notes (where I can also link my existing Google documents, no less)  will be highly advantageous to me as I restart my studies in computer science.  I hope its availability on GitHub following deployment enables it to help other beginners, as well.

While I cannot say that this was my first foray into HTML, CSS, or JavaScript it was certainly the deepest dive I've taken into any of the languages before.  I have never interacted with Git or GitHub before either and getting to use them repeatedly has helped me understand just how important a tool they are.  Their usefulness in debugging, enabling team work, and centralizing a repo for all of the various versions worked on throughout the project will be invaluable.  I firmly believe that I will use them constantly throughout my developer experience.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

My Prework Study Guide is an actively-updated base of information regarding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  It will list all of the topics obtained during our prework and beyond as I continue to update it.  Each section of the website contains my notes taken through the prework and main content of our course.  If the DevTools console is open, we can see the JavaScript running it will list out each topic individually and select a random topic for study.
